# Lifts Tracker

Lifts Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to give you a flexible way to track your progress in the 5/3/1 program, without needing to follow a strict schedule. It supports asynchronous tracking of the four main lifts, incorporating autoregulation, automated deload week scheduling, and advanced programming concepts like Leader and Anchor blocks from the 5/3/1 Forever program.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Tracking**: Track lifts independently without being tied to a rigid schedule.
- **Autoregulation**: Automatically adjusts your training max based on AMRAP performance to ensure sustainable progression.
- **Deload Scheduling**: Deload weeks are automatically triggered when performance metrics indicate a need for recovery.
- **Leader and Anchor Blocks**: Implements the 5/3/1 Forever block programming for structured progression (this is turned off by default).
- **Adaptive increment tuning**: each cycle the app looks back at your last N AMRAP results and can shrink or grow your base increment automatically
- **Data Backup & Restore**: Export your complete training history to a JSON file for safekeeping, and restore from backup when needed.
- **Offline Functionality**: Works offline after installation and behaves like a native app.

Once installed, the app will work offline and behave like a native app.

## Training Programming

### Autoregulation Based on AMRAP Performance
Lifts Tracker dynamically adjusts your training max based on your performance in the AMRAP set of each cycle. If you hit at least 1 rep, your training max will increase by the standard increment. For every 5 additional reps (10, 15, 20, etc.), an extra 5 lbs is added, allowing faster progression when you exceed targets without overloading. This adaptive approach helps keep your lifts challenging yet achievable, promoting sustainable strength gains over time.

### Deload Weeks for Optimal Recovery
Lifts Tracker automatically schedules a deload week when needed to help prevent burnout and overtraining. If you complete two consecutive cycles with fewer than 5 reps in the final AMRAP set of Week 3, the app will trigger a deload week. During this week, youâ€™ll lift the same weights but with about 30% fewer reps, allowing for active recovery without losing progress. This adaptive feature ensures you stay on track, promoting steady gains while giving your body time to recover.

### Leader and Anchor Blocks
Lifts Tracker incorporates the Leader and Anchor programming from the 5/3/1 Forever program:
- **Leader Blocks**: Focus on base strength development with high volume and straightforward progression. During Leader blocks, prescribed sets follow the "5s PRO" format, using fixed percentages (65%, 75%, 85%) and 5 reps per set.
- **Anchor Blocks**: Transition to lower volume, higher intensity work to peak strength. Each week in an Anchor block progresses with increasing intensity:
  - Week 1: 65%, 75%, 85% for 5 reps each.
  - Week 2: 70%, 80%, 90% for 3 reps each.
  - Week 3: 75%, 85%, 95% for 5, 3, and 1 rep, respectively.

Each training cycle alternates between Leader and Anchor blocks, ensuring balanced progression and recovery.

### Customizable Configurations

Lifts Tracker allows users to fine-tune their training preferences by importing a configuration file (use the config.JSON file as a template). Parameters such as AMRAP thresholds, deload percentages, training max multipliers, and block cycles can be customized to match your individual training style.

#### How to Upload a Configuration File
1. Click the **Import Config** button in the app interface.
2. Select a modified config.JSON file.
3. The configuration will be saved and applied immediately in the current session.
