# Lifts Tracker
Lifts Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help you asynchronously track your workouts and follow the 5/3/1 periodization scheme for the four main lifts independently of one another. The app incorporated autoregulation and automated deload week scheduling.

## Training Programming

#### Autoregulation Based on AMRAP Performance
Lifts Tracker dynamically adjusts your training max based on your performance in the AMRAP set of each cycle. If you hit at least 1 rep, your training max will increase by the standard increment. For every 5 additional reps (10, 15, 20, etc.), an extra 5 lbs is added, allowing faster progression when you exceed targets without overloading. This adaptive approach helps keep your lifts challenging yet achievable, promoting sustainable strength gains over time.

#### Deload Weeks for Optimal Recovery
Lifts Tracker automatically schedules a deload week when needed to help prevent burnout and overtraining. If you complete two consecutive cycles with fewer than 5 reps in the final AMRAP set of Week 3, the app will trigger a deload week. During this week, youâ€™ll lift the same weights but with about 30% fewer reps, allowing for active recovery without losing progress. This adaptive feature ensures you stay on track, promoting steady gains while giving your body time to recover.
